# bookbot
BookBot is my first project!

This is a guided project I have done as part of the boot.dev training program.

It started off as a very simple letter counting program, with its main purpose being getting comfortable with a python/shell/git setup.

I decided to expand upon it and make it a simple, functional, clean program which has the following features:
1) Pure output of the loaded string into the terminal, which was part of the original boot.dev task. (who needs cat hehehe)
2) Counting the instance of every single english alphabet letter. This was also part of the original boot.dev task.
3) A list of every single word appearing in the string along with the count of their appearances throughout the string.
3.1) The same option as 3 except all the words who only appear once in the text are grouped together at the end, for visual clarity.
4) A function expanding on the previous function, letting the user choose the range of the most common words to display, from rank #a to rank #b.
5) A slightly useful function, counting the appearance of a given word and displaying the count.
6) A function which lets the user enter two words, where every instance of the first word in the document will be replaced by the second word.
Has a second function of simply removing the given word from the document. Lets the user save the modified document, otherwise keep on working on the original document.

I plan to use this code as a benchmark, for when I return after gaining more coding skill and knowledge, I want to be able to see how much I have grown.
