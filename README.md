This is a guided project I have done as part of the boot.dev training program.

It started off as a very simple letter counting program, with its main purpose being getting comfortable with a Python/shell/git setup.

I decided to expand upon it and make it a simple, functional, clean program that has the following features:
1) Pure output of the loaded string into the terminal, which was part of the original boot.dev task. (Who needs cat hehehe)
2) Counting the instances of every single English alphabet letter. This was also part of the original boot.dev task.
3) A list of every single word appearing in the document, along with the count of their appearances throughout the document.
4) The same option as 3) except all the words that only appear once in the text are grouped together at the end for visual clarity.
5) A function expanding on the previous function, letting the user choose the range of the most common words to display, from rank #a to rank #b. Reversed ranking also works if #a > #b.
6) A slightly useful function for counting the appearance of a given word and displaying the count.
7) A function that lets the user enter two words, where every instance of the first word in the document will be replaced by the second word.
Has the second function of simply removing the given word from the document. Lets the user save the document as the temporary working document; otherwise, keep on working with the original document.
8) An option to save the current temporary working document. The user can play around with the temporary working document by replacing or removing words, review the temporary working document, and then choose this option to save it permanently.

I plan to use this code as a benchmark, for when I return after gaining more coding skills and knowledge, I want to be able to see how much I have grown.
